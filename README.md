# Image_Classification_Tensor_Flow

A simple application that uses transfer learning to train a model from a bottle dataset. The prediction for the labels should be above 80% accurarcy in this case. This project is based on [TensorFlow Transfer Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning) and takes ideas from there. There are graphs printed for training purposes and the model is saved and tested on script that accesses the camera.
